/ -----forward slash is a parent user in linux
ls-----get a list of files and directories
ls -l-----get a list of files in long format
ls -A-----get a list of hidden files
ls -Al ----get a list of hidden and normal files
touch page.txt ----create a text file
cat page.txt ----get the content from the text file
grep root page.txt----filter the words from the text file
tail -n -5 page.txt----to display the content from last 5 lines from the text file
head -n -5 page.txt------ to display the content from top 5 lines from the text file
awk-----to display content in column wise
awk -F : '{print$1,print$2,....}'
curl ---to download the files,zip,tar,...
curl https://.....//jenkins.jar
if we download with the same name of the url we can use
curl -O https://.....//jenkins.jar
if we download the url with some customized name we can use
curl -o new.txt https://.....//jenkins.jar
the above cmd will not work because curl cmd not download the url in new.txt file(no proper location)
curl -L -o  new.txt https://.....//jenkins.jar
the above command will works


Redirectors:Earlier we are giving the i/ps through keyboard and getting o/p through cmd prompt.
 now we have to pass the input in a file and execute that file and to display the content to the file
 for this we have to go for redirectories....
============
'>' single redirector will display some content only.
'>' , 2> : displays some content and errors
>/tmp/expense.log---- override the  the content
2>/tmp/err----displays an error

to display both content and error in one operator so we can use '&>'
&>/tmp/expense.log
it displays override content i.e last "error content will display"
so we overcome this problem we can go for ">>"
when we use ">>" it displays complete content about backend.sh
append the content
">>/tmp/expense.log"



VAriables:
=============
# is a comment in shell scripting
to display the content we can use "echo"
there are some special characters:
$0,$1,$*(to display the output)
$#(to display the total length depends on numbers,string)enclosed with double quotes
